# Test Genie API

A basic experiment with Julia's Genie web framework.

## Setup and Installing Dependencies

I had trouble installing Genie in the default Julia environment on my machine, but it worked fine when I made a new environment (similar to venv for Python) for this project.

To set up a new Julia environment, go to the project directory and activate the Julia REPL command prompt. Then, type `]` to use the REPL interface for Pkg. You can create a new environment by typing `activate .`, and the typing `activate` will bring you back to the default environment.

Once you successfully create a new environment, the Genie install should work by just typing `add Genie`. You can check that it has been successfully installed  by using the `st` command.
